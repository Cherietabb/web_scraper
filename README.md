# Simple Web Scraper

##A small project using:
* Node.js v6.9.1
* Cheerio v0.22.0
* Request v2.79.0

## Installing Node

### For Windows users:
* Go to the [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) website and download the LTS version of node.
* Be sure to install it under the C: drive, e.g. `C:\nodejs\`
* Once installed, open the system environment variables, located in the control panel and make sure that node.js has been added.
* To see if Node was installed, open a command window and type `node -v`.
* To use node CLI, open a command window and type `node`.  This should bring you to the node repl.
* Use `ctrl + C` to exit.

### For Mac users:

* If using Homebrew, open the Terminal app and type `brew install node`.
* To see if Node is installed, type `node -v` in the Terminal.  This should print the version number so you'll see something like `v6.9.1`.
